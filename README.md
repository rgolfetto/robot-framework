Hey, I'm learning robot framework.

For learning purposes we'll be using the space separated format for tests

The basic keywords already from robot:

https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Collections.html 
https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#library-documentation-top
https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/String.html
https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Collections.html
https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html#Get%20List%20Items

The idea is to create a repo with functions to be easily reusable anywhere, only needing to do some small changes for each specific use.
And to create functions that can be read and understood by anyone.
